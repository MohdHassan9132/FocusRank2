      question: "How does study tracking work?",
      answer:
        "You track your study by submitting a raw study video or a YouTube study video from your channel. The platform automatically calculates your study time based on the video duration — no manual timers or fake entries.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to record myself every time?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Study time is verified through video to keep tracking honest and fair for everyone. You can upload a raw video or use an existing YouTube study video.",
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of videos can I upload?",
      answer:
        "You can upload raw study videos or share a YouTube link from your own channel. The video should clearly represent your study session.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do rewards and streaks work?",
      answer:
        "Rewards are based on verified study consistency and long-term streaks, not on short sessions or competition. The goal is to support healthy study habits, not pressure.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is my data safe?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Your videos and study data are securely stored and only used for study verification and analytics. We do not sell personal data.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is the platform free to use?",
      answer:
        "You can start for free with basic study tracking. Some advanced features and reward eligibility are part of paid plans.",
